# Modern Default HTML
I believe the Web was always meant to be a responsive platform open to all. HTML in its purest form is perfectly functional and legible - design decisions made thereafter can either improve or tarnish the default out-of-the-box experience. 

That's why I decided to share my default template for starting new projects - it helps me focus on the sensible defaults that are already in place and think carefully about the decisions I make from the ground up. This isn't a new idea by any means, it's perhaps a more focused effort. I have made sure that:

* There are no solutions imposed upon you as a designer (for example if this included a responsive solution for tables, the approach may not suit the data you are trying to show or the problem you are trying to solve)
* On a related note - there is nothing in this project you will need to undo

Just an unobtrusive, minor tweak to the default web page to make it accessible on modern devices.
